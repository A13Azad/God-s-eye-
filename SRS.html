    <h1 id="1.1 Purpose"><ins>1.Introduction</ins><br><br>1.1 Purpose</h1>
    <p>In the digital age, eBook reader apps have replaced conventional printed books. Now you can simply read your favorite book on your smartphone or tablet by downloading apps on your Android device. Several of the eBook apps even provide hundreds of free books. With these apps, you can quickly search for a book of your choice and start reading them right away. You no longer have to visit physical stores to buy books. But in our project, we are going to build eBook reading with the ability to monitor students by teachers. Teachers can upload their study materials as pdf and the students can read those pdfs. The interesting part is that the teachers will know how much that student read. Using the eye detection, the apps can monitor is the student is reading or not. This is the main features of our project.</p>

  <h1 id="1.4 Product Scope">1.4 Product Scope</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this software to monitor the students and keep track of the student’s study. The teacher user will be able to upload eBook/PDF and monitor the activities of students such as how many pages the student has gone through and how much time they have studied. In order to check whether the reader is the intended student the software will run a face recognition of the reader. And also check whether the eye is open or not. The student will be able to read the eBooks/PDF file which will be uploaded into the software from the teachers. The student will also have their face data stored for recognition.</p>

  <p></p><li>This eReader application is a student’s tool for mastering reading assignments. This application offers an alternative reading methodology that makes reading focused and easy.</li>

 <li>This is a virtual platform where, Teachers and students can be in here together at a time. </li>

<li>Teachers can sends PDFs to their studests and can customize the reading experience for each student and track their improvement over time.</li>

<li>By using this application, Teacher can easily monitor their students, while they are reading or not or how much time his/her students holds their consentration.</li>

<li>Removing the eye movements associated with traditional reading methods not only reduces the number of times your eyes move when reading, but also decreases the number of times your eyes must pass over a word for your brain to understand it. This makes extremely efficient, precise, convenient and comfortable.</li>

  <p>List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).</p>
