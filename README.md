### Project Purpose ###

* In the digital age, eBook reader apps have replaced conventional printed books. Now you can simply read your favorite book on your smartphone or tablet by downloading apps on your Android device. Several of the eBook apps even provide hundreds of free books. With these apps, you can quickly search for a book of your choice and start reading them right away. You no longer have to visit physical stores to buy books. But in our project, we are going to build eBook reading with the ability to monitor students by teachers. Teachers can upload their study materials as pdf and the students can read those pdfs. The interesting part is that the teachers will know how much that student read. Using the eye detection, the apps can monitor is the student is reading or not. This is the main features of our project.
